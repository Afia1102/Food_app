The Food Delivery Application is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate food delivery
services exclusively for restaurants and customers. With three distinct user roles—Admin, Restaurant,
and Customer—the application streamlines the process of adding dishes, placing orders, and managing accounts.
Admins oversee account verification, approving restaurant and customer accounts post-verification.
Restaurants have access to screens allowing them to effortlessly add dishes with specific details such as name,
description, price, and images, as well as view placed orders. On the customer side, users can explore a list of restaurants, 
browse available dishes, and seamlessly place orders. All screens and interactions have been meticulously designed in Figma,
ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience for both restaurants and customers.
